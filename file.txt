This time for real its a no brainer how I want to continue to code.
I feel like I've been doing this a long time but it takes what it takes.
I'm wondering if for some reason there is something I'm not doing, 
that I should be doing. On the other hand I have been doing alot.
In a speech by DHH, he mentions that there is really to much to know
at first. And knowing it all is not necessary in the beginning.
However it's important to a good foundation of the basics.
The basics are essentially and identifying the basics is important
in the beginning. There is no one size fits all but there is a 
baseline to reach in order to get your first software developer
job. Getting the job is half the battle. Knowing how to solve problems
is key in software development. Remember getting a good foundation
in the basics and not having to know it all is key. Good luck.
